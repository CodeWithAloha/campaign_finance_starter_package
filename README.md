# Intro
This project is meant to help you hit the ground running with an html visualization of the hawaii campaign finance data. It was created for [Civic*Celerator 2013](http://civic.celerator.org/).

## Details
How to get the url for a data set from the data.hawaii.gov (Socrata) link:

Take a URL and look for the unique id at the end. In this case it is `3maa-4fgr`:
https://data.hawaii.gov/Community/Expenditures-Made-By-Hawaii-State-and-County-Candi/3maa-4fgr

Then add it to this url `https://data.hawaii.gov/resource/<unique-id>.json` (adding json at the end), resulting in `https://data.hawaii.gov/3maa-4fgr.json`

Add info about what you can filter on
