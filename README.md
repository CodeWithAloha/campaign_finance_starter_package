Take a URL and look for the unique id at the end. In this case it is `3maa-4fgr`:
https://data.hawaii.gov/Community/Expenditures-Made-By-Hawaii-State-and-County-Candi/3maa-4fgr

Then add it to this url `https://data.hawaii.gov/resource/<unique-id>.json` (adding json at the end), resulting in `https://data.hawaii.gov/3maa-4fgr.json`
